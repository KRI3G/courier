## Process

1. Get the basics down
  - LAMP setup on local machine
    - Might want to set up TLS between webserver and MariaDB
  - Pull and push data from website to database
2. Three Sites
  - First for creating entry
  - Second, dashboard for active and past entries
  - Third, user access control
